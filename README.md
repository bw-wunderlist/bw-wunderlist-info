Useful info about the project

Pitch: Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app).  No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.  

1. An on-boarding process for a new general user 
3. Ability to easily create / setup a to do list item
4. Ability to easily edit / update / mark items as complete
5. Ability to completely delete an item
6. Ability to easily search / find items
7. Ability to schedule items and automatically repeat on a weekly or daily or monthly basis
8. Pages to display their existing to-doâ€™s for the day, or for the month. Can also view items marked as completed, and deleted items (saved for seven days) 

Stretch: Add the ability to collaborate. Share your lists and work collaboratively on projects with your colleagues, friends and family.  Add notifcation reminders through an API like Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) or Growl (http://growl.info/) to allow volunteers to be notified when a question is posted in their business type.
